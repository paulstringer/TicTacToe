!1 OCSlimProject Example Test Page

Below is a simple Decision Table based Acceptance Test. It sends input to an instance of a Fixture which is implemented in your Xcode project. This is done by adding a class of the same name e.g. 'FixtureExample.swift' to your Acceptance Test target. 

The first column 'input' will set a property of the same name. The expected 'output?' denoted by columns with '?' at the end of the property name are returned by your Fixture and verified against the expected value in that column.

Click 'Test' to run this page and see this in action. After that check out ''!-FixtureExample.swift-!'' in your Xcode project to see the 'FixtureExample.swift' implementation.

|Fixture Example|
|input |output? |
|foo   |bar     |
|bar   |baz     |
